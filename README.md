# neo4j-uuid #

## purpose ##
A lot of [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org) based projects I've seen need a unique identifier for nodes/relationship to reference contents in the graph database from some third party system. The most obvious thing namely using node.getId() is a bad choice since after deletion of a node its id might be recycled. For details on why and how this works, see an excellect [blog post](http://digitalstain.blogspot.de/2010/10/neo4j-internals-file-storage.html).
A best practice for having unique identifiers is to assign each node/relationship a uuid property and let Neo4j perform autoindexing on the uuid property. Third party systems store only the UUID. A simple index lookup retrieves then the referenced node or relationship in the graph database.

## build & install ##
neo4j-uuid uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) as build system. To install uuid-neo4j in a Neo4j server instance:
* call `./gradlew assemble`
* copy `./build/libs/neo4j-uuid.jar` to your Neo4j server's `plugins` directory
* copy the latest version of http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.uuid/java-uuid-generator to Neo4j's `plugins` directory as well (will automate that step in future).
* amend `$NEO4J_SERVER/conf/neo4j-server.properties` with the following line:

    org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.extension.uuid=/db/uuid


### implementation details ###
* for testing [Spock](http://www.spockframework.org) is used
* Neo4j scans using JDK ServiceLoader for registered implementations of KernelExtensionFactory. We register UUIDKernelExtensionFactory that passes back an instance of UUIDLifeCycle. UUIDLifeCycle takes care of setting up auto indexing for `uuid` properties and registers a `UUIDTransactionEventHandler`
* a second component provides a unmanaged extension for querying nodes/rels by uuid, see `UUIDRestInterface`
